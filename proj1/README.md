## Grading for Project g <a name="project-g"></a>
| Notes | Evidence | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Video |  |  |
| Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... |  |  |
| but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)	|  |
| Number of commits |  |
| Number of commits: by different people |  |
| Issues reports: there are many |  |
| Issues are being closed	|  |
| DOI badge: exists |  |
| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |  |
| Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |  |
| Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z |  |
| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing	|  |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. |  |
| Use of version control tools |  |
| Use of style checkers |  |
| Use of code formatters. |  |
| Use of syntax checkers. |  |
| Use of code coverage |  |
| Other automated analysis tools |  |
| Test cases exist |  |
| Test cases are routinely executed |  |
| The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up |  |
| Issues are discussed before they are closed |  |
| Chat channel: exists |  |
| Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. |  |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files |  |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) |  |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer) |  |
| Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |  |
| Short release cycles |  |
