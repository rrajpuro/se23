# CSC510 - Project 1, Essay <a name="head"></a>
## Introduction
In the world of software development, the ability to assess and reuse existing code is a valuable skill. We, the team, embarked on a mission to train ourselves in precisely thatâ€”evaluating and extending code created by our peers from previous years. This essay explores the process and experiences of Project 1, which involved selecting, grading, and working on various projects from past students' repositories. Through a series of trials and tribulations, we learned valuable lessons, identified the ideal project, and devised strategies for improvement.

## The Selection Process
The first critical step for Project 1 was to choose the right project to work on. We began by meticulously examining all the repositories assigned to us, aiming to identify projects that could be both run and extended effectively. It enabled us to chart our course of action and decide whether to delve into new technologies or build upon existing codebases. To ensure that everyone would be able to run the project regardless of the OS each team member is using. We decided to reserve NCSU VCLs so that there are no issues with dependencies.

## Grading as a Starting Point
One pivotal decision made during Project 1 was to start with grading rather than attempting to run projects immediately. This choice provided several advantages. Firstly, it allowed the team to gain a comprehensive understanding of the repositories, the projects themselves, and their prerequisites. Grading exposed us to the inner workings of each project, helping us uncover crucial insights. Additionally, it served as a litmus test for the quality of project documentation and code maintenance. A well-documented project indicated a strong foundation for future work.

## Challenges Encountered
As we delved into the journey, we encountered a series of challenges and hurdles. One project, [WolfTrack3.0](https://github.com/nehajaideep/WolfTrack3.0), which aimed to assist with job applications and tracking, posed a significant roadblock. It relied heavily on the "AWS Relational Database Service-RDS" as its primary database, necessitating contacting "wolftrackse@gmail.com" for AWS IAM user account details to access it. This dependency made it impractical for us to proceed, prompting us to explore other options.

Another project under consideration was [C.E.L.T Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/mrpudlo/SE_Project1), which involved machine learning and speech/audio recognition. Although Python was familiar territory, the team lacked experience with the specific technologies required for this project. We decided to keep it as a secondary option, prioritizing projects that aligned more closely with our existing skill set.

[ItemStockTracker](https://github.com/shahrk/ItemStockTracker/), while appearing promising at first glance, ultimately proved less adaptable for extension. Its limited scope for enhancement led us to search for a more suitable project.

The [Units Converter Extension](https://github.com/NCSU-S/units_converter_extension), a Chrome browser extension to facilitate online instant unit conversion. The documentation was very thorough, providing a viable project to work on. We followed the documentation and we successfully ran the project. However, we faced a new difficulty: finding significant opportunities for extension within an already comprehensive application that covered a wide array of units for conversion. So, we kept this aside as a potential candidate for extension.

## MyDollarBot-BOTGo: The Chosen Project
The journey eventually led to [MyDollarBot-BOTGo](https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo), a Telegram bot designed to record, track, and display expenses. The cross-platform nature of the bot, along with its dependency on the well-documented Telegram API, made it an appealing choice. Initially, we encountered hiccups due to a lack of thorough documentation review. However, after a more comprehensive examination of the documentation, we successfully ran the project.

With MyDollarBot-BOTGo selected as the project of choice, we began brainstorming potential extensions. Extension ideas included:
- Implementing a shared bot feature to track group expenses.
 - The idea of a shared bot is to add the bot to a chat group and let it track the expenditure of the group. Upon research, the pyTelegramBotAPI would be our way to implement this feature.
- Enhancing the bot's user interface for improved user experience.
- Providing more detailed graphs and diagrams.
- Adding an alerting system to the bot to alert/remind users of payments.

## Lessons Learned
The journey through Project 1 was not without its share of challenges and missteps. We reflected on our experiences and identified several key lessons for future endeavors.
Firstly, we realized the importance of regular team meetings, acknowledging that sporadic and unplanned interactions had negatively impacted our efficiency.
Secondly, we recognized the missed opportunity to rank projects after grading. Ranking would have allowed us to prioritize projects based on documentation quality and dependencies, potentially saving time and effort.
Lastly, we acknowledge the need for a more balanced approach to dividing work within the team. Instead of adhering strictly to either a teamwork or divide-and-conquer model, we aim to implement a hybrid strategy, leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

## Conclusion
Project 1 was a journey of discovery, trial, and learning. It epitomized the challenges and rewards of assessing and extending code from previous students. The team's perseverance in the face of obstacles led us to MyDollarBot-BOTGo, a promising project for extension. As we look back on these experiences, we are determined to avoid repeating past mistakes and to continue growing as software developers. In the ever-evolving field of technology, adaptability, and continuous improvement are key, and Project 1 served as a valuable stepping stone on that path.
